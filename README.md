🚀 Hi, I'm 0Zane !

Highschool student passionated by embedded systems and technology from software, to hardware .

# About Me

I discovered my passion for technology at 14, starting with Python. A few months ago, I fell in love with electronics, which pushed me to go deeper into low-level programming. I am now learning C++ through the MCU ecosystem and learning to bring my ideas to life by designing custom PCBs.

🔭 Current Project: Building a smart watch grom scratch

🌱 Learning Path: Deepening my knowledge in C++ and PCB Design, and soon diving into 3D Modeling (CAD) for mechanical prototyping.

📈 Philosophy: "Getting at least 1% better everyday"
